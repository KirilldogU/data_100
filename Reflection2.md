#### Prompt:
###### Prompt: “Revolutions in science have often been preceded by revolutions in measurement.” <br>Sinan Aral (cited in Kitchin, 2014)   In “Big Data, New Epistemologies and Paradigm Shifts” by Rob Kitchin the author emphasizes the importance of measurement as a significant contributing factor for improved description and analysis of complex natural and/or social phenomenon. How is the advent of big data serving to advance this revolution in measurement and subsequently, how is this revolution in measurement serving to elevate data science as an interdisciplinary field of study? How is the data deluge advancing a better understanding of human movement, behavior and relationships? How does data science contribute towards our improved understanding of human development as a complex and adapting social and economic system?

#### Response:
Data science and statistical analysis, in conjunction with cross disciplinary knowledge,  have the opportunity to revolutionize many fields of study through leading to quicker analysis, discovery of difficult to spot conclusions, and using prediction mechanisms to determine rules (correlation instead of causation). A central part of modern data science is the use of big data – extrapolating from massive data sets that are (semi) automatically generated, exhaustive in scope, and includes a variety of data, some of which may not even be necessary. Thanks the developments in technology these massive data sets can now constantly be used to develop new theories and conclusions just through correlational data analysis, leading to some speculation about how scientific this method is.
  
As developed by Kitchin and Anderson in their respective articles, the advent of big data and its applications through data science have the capacity to completely transform many scientific fields. Previously social and hard science research was primarily conducted along a certain path, with reasonable hypotheses being proposed and then tested by experiments specifically designed to prove or disprove. However data science can be applied to other fields in order to extrapolate data far quicker, through simply looking for correlations instead of examining some causation. By combing through massive data sets and looking for initially unnoticeable trends, big data can lead to conclusions far quicker than normal scientific process as the mere correlation of data can be discerned instead of testing possible hypotheses one by one. It is due to this capability of unsupervised data learning that big data has become a keyword and an important application in both retail and technology companies, and now in many fields of scientific research. Through quickly grasping what would be difficult to notice trends, data science is much of new research and is at the forefront of interdisciplinary science. 
    
The quintessential scientific models are often not even necessary in research nowadays, as they can be replaced by a correlational examination of massive data sets. However as Kitchin correctly notes, there are a variety of factors that make data science far from an end-all-be-all solution. Firstly data analysis can frequently latch onto correlational but meaningless trends, and especially with building models that over trained on a data set this becomes an issue. It can lead to inaccurate and even illogical conclusions, merely because the data set developed a correlation by chance. Additionally hard knowledge of the scientific field in question is necessary for applying data science, as a data analyst does not have the skills to properly interpret advanced scientific data. Furthermore although it may seem that with machine learning and data science that models can learn from data without being affected by any prejudices or researcher’s conclusions, the models and algorithms being used already include some semblance of scientific method that may prevent data science from catching some odd but potentially helpful conclusions.
    
As Kitchin develops, there are certainly a variety of issues prevalent to data science at the moment. One that she emphasizes (in addition to those listed in the last paragraph) is that data science is poised to replace much of the old scientific method, but there are not strict rules laid out for what makes data science applications valid or conclusive proof. In order to solidly move forward with data science in cross-disciplinary research these standards need to be developed. However the new Petabyte Age offers many opportunities for humanity’s development, as we can use data tools and machine learning to learn more about our society and science than ever before. Although correlation is not causation, with proper scientific applications many seemingly strange correlations can teach us a good bit about our world.
