#### Project involves using satellite and geospatial data to map attributes of country and create plots and statistics analyzing the strength of correlation between variables.

## Country - Georgia

### 3.1 Deliverable:
##### Population Density vs Log of Population (divided by country regions)

### 3.2 Deliverable:
##### Correlation Between Night Time Lights and Population. With a fitted regression and confidence interval.
