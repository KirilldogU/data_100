#### Prompt:
###### Prompt: Joshua Blumenstock states that a humbler data science could transform international development while also limiting the number of alleged silver bullets that have missed their mark in recent years. Describe the promise, pitfalls and ways forward Blumenstock uses as the foundation for his thesis. Additionally, consider the following statements from three of your classmates regarding this article. (1) "Good intent is not enough in data science when dealing with the problems which determine people's experiences" Anna Raymond (2) "Transparency is the underlying issue to many of these problems, so an increase in this on both ends (data based issues & human based issues) could lead to better results." Nira Nair (3) "In lieu of such drastic potential for promoting applications yet demoralizing hinderances, the balancing act can become difficult." Kayla Seggelke How do you respond to these ideas regarding "good intent", "transparency" and the difficult "balancing act" when considering the intersection of human development with data science? Please prepare your response for next Thursday's class.



#### Response:
Joshua Blumenstock makes the case that data science can be used to transform international development, as it can be used as a cost-saving and optimizing tool in order to bring about the greatest change on a limited budget. He provides a variety of evidence on the methods in which data science can be applied in the field of international development and humanitarian projects, but also describes several shortcomings prevalent to the data science field and issues that have arisen during implementation of data science models in such projects. Ultimately, he suggests that although there have been some issues in execution, data science tools still have the opportunity to vitally change international development and boost its efficiency through some technological applications.

To drive his argument Blumenstock first provides several examples of the ways in which data science and statistical tools can revolutionize development – for example using phone call data to provide credit to those who would otherwise be unable to receive financial services, or using satellite and phone data to judge where humanitarian aid is most needed. These examples serve as important building blocks to his argument as they show that data science is already applied to provide a net benefit to the world, and to bolster the lives of others. However he then provides several counterpoints describing the issues prevalent with data science, and how they apply to the development field. Firstly he describes that statistical tools can easily be applied to manipulate and oppress people – whether by greedy and shady companies (such as those issuing high interest payday loans) or by oppressive governments (China’s social credit score initiative). These examples clearly demonstrate the serious issues that can come with applying the data science field and the opportunities it gives rise to for effectively manipulating and oppressing a massive population. Although this counterpoint is a warning sign about the applications of data science, and makes it worth reconsidering whether statical data should be readily available -  it not does contribute to the effectiveness of data science in bolstering development, so is tangential.

Blumenstock then develops the other issues he feels are important to data science and human development. He explains that there is a lack of clear evidence that these data science tools have been effectively applied in the past to aid development, and ample evidence of statistical shortcomings – often related to training algorithms on a few model cases and then attempting to overapply to other less relevant cases (such as comparing developed countries with developing). Additionally he notes that other issues also hurt the implementation of data science tools, such as data being overly focused on incomplete information – for instance using phone data to judge wealth (as the poorest will not have phones) – and the general lack of regulation on this topic that allows some companies to manipulate users while NPOs are unable to harness data. All of these issues that Blumenstock provides demonstrate that while statistical tools can certainly provide a benefit to large populations, at the moment they are mainly useful for small applications by companies attempting to increase profits and have not been properly applied by the humanitarian community. 

Blumenstock’s suggestions on how best to tackle these issues pertinent to data science in order to help the global community provide convincing arguments that are corroborated by our classmates. As described by Nira Nair, one of the core issues is a lack of transparency as to the impact of the data solutions and where the data its sourced from. Blumenstock explains that making more private data available to the researcher community would help development, and that algorithms can be specifically created that can manage resource allocation (such as in banking) according to both profit generation and impact production. Additionally as developed by Anna Raymond, the application of data science to social issues requires more than good intent – it requires serious investment and research. In order to successfully use data science as a tool for increasing human development, and not just as a method for tech giants to generate even larger profits, it requires creating solutions and training professionals specifically for the task of human development applications.
