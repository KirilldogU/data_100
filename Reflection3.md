###### Question #1. How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Sen’s definition to include the idea of complexity?
<br>

#### Response:
Throughout the lecture Owen Barder makes a strong case that development cannot be fully portrayed by simply economic growth and efficacy, which emphasize analyzing the output of firms in an economy and the wealth and buying power of average/median households. Instead Barder develops that this view has frequently led to linear models that attempt to highlight one point as the core foundation of economic growth, and these efforts have all met with failure. So Barder emphasizes that its important to include a wider perspective in order to see all development, and he uses much of Amartya Sen’s development definition – which states that “development is … enlarging people’s choises, capabilities and freedoms, so that they can live a long and healthy life, have access to knowledge, a decent standard of living, and participate in the life of their community.” Barden agrees with this view but adds that economic development is an incredibly complicated parameter and must be viewed through the analysis of many variables in a nonlinear model.

###### Question #2. What was the toaster project? What did Thomas Thwaites attempt to do? Was he successful? What is the significance of this example in the context of complexity?
<br>

#### Response:
The toaster project was the work of engineering student Thomas Thwaites, who attempted to build his own very simple toaster out of base parts that he acquired around England. After disassembling a toaster he found that it contained more than 400 parts, and he set about acquiring, crafting, and assembling them to create a $6 toaster. He was ultimately successful in creating a toaster which worked properly for 5 seconds before burning itself fully, which considering the complexity of the task I would call a reasonable success. The significance of this example is it demonstrates how effectively our complex economies function, as all the many parts of actual toasters are sourced, crafted, and assembled together by massive developed economies at extremely high efficiency and low cost to the consumer. This further highlight that many factors are at work affecting the cooperation of firms, institutions, and labor in the creation of something as simple as the toaster.

###### Question #3.  According to Barder how successful have economic models been at describing and predicting growth over the past 50 years?
<br>

#### Response:
According to Barder economic models have been largely ineffective/useless at describing and predicting growth over the past 50 years. He emphasizes that these failures are due to economists attempting to use linear systems which analyze one or a few economic factors as the single roots of development. Whether these factors are strength of institutions, technological innovation, access to capital for investment, or other factors, according to Barder all the models that only emphasize a few factors have failed to accurately describe and predict growth for decades. He develops on this by saying that the next step necessary to accurately graph and predict progress is representing growth in nonlinear (complex) models which take many factors into account.

###### Question #4.  Who was Steve Jones? What did he do at uni-lever? Was he successful? How significant were his results?
<br>

#### Response:
Steve Jones is a rather famous evolutionary biologist, but before he rose to prominence in that field, he made a large contribution to a soap company called Uni-lever. During the creation of soaps a nozzle is used to distribute the material which then hardens into a useful and tangible shape. In order to improve efficiency in soap making Steve Jones developed a new nozzle through randomly distorting the original nozzle and then distorting the produced nozzles for many generations. After 40 some generations of distortions Steve Jones was able to make a nozzle that was massively more efficient than the previously used nozzle. His results were very significant as they demonstrated that although some things can’t be portrayed through a linear model, they can still be improved upon through random change and testing of output. Additionally they demonstrated the value of attempting to graph nonlinear models for development.

###### Question #5.  What is a complex adaptive system? What are some of its important features?
<br>

#### Response:
A complex adaptive system is a system with many parts and variables that functions to create some output. Importantly Barder states that although linear economic models have failed to represent development and growth for decades, he states that complex adaptive systems may be able to do better through  analyzing far more variables and not viewing any as too important. Some features of adaptive systems: some small details may have far larger effects than would seem obvious, there are patterns to be found, some patterns are not linked to specific details, and these systems will not lead to equilibrium.

###### Question #6.  Who was Haile Sellasie?  According to Barder (and Kapuscinski), how did Ethiopia during the time of The Emporer exemplify the suppression of emergent systemic change?
<br>

#### Response:
Hailie Sallasie was a mid-20th century Emperor of Ethiopia who successfully maintained power and suppressed dissent in his country for decades. Kapuscinski’s book The Emperor analyzed the fall of the Ethiopian monarchy and the court of Sallasie. The court featured misinformation, heavy handed mismanagement from the top-down, and the use of police and spies to keep down popular dissent and not improve the lives of the population. The Emperor demonstrates that despite many factors that would contribute to economic progress, it is highly possible for some factors – like a power-hungry and status maintaining elite – to be able to suppress development.

###### Question #7. Why does Barder recommend resisting engineering as a policy implication? What did he mean by iso-morphic mimicry?
<br>

#### Response:
Barder explains that foreign investors and aid provides have a habit of coming to undeveloped countries and offering money for the engineering of certain institutions or policies. Barder then argues that this engineering by foreign parties leads to poor effects where the money is usually squandered or used to create institutions and policy that appear to be similar to the goal, but are largely useless. The development of these institutions and policy can be labeled iso-morphic mimicry as it involves the creation of fake assets which appear to be close to the goal but are largely ineffective at doing the main core function. This may be because undeveloped/developing countries lack other lower level developments necessary for these institutions and policies to succeed, and suggests that engineering should be avoided as a policy for aid.

###### Question #8.  What does Barder mean by "resist fatalism"? Who was Norman Borlaug and what is the green revolution?
<br>

#### Response:
When Barder says to “resist fatalism”	he means that human development can go in any path, as humans have far more scope for variety and rapid innovation than something slow like evolution. As such our future could carry us in many directions, and only through variations on the many options can we produce a society that is tangibly better for humanity. Barder suggests that our development is varied and diverse by contrasting it with evolution, which has provided a massive variety of life simply by testing whether organisms can survive. Barder also describes the contributions of Norman Borlaug to explain why human development can do better than evolution’s progress. Norman Borlaug was an agronomist who designed several varieties of highly efficient plants that were able to massively boost agricultural output around the world and save hundreds of millions from starvation. This man’s enormous contribution to community improved the lives of countless people, and is an example of humans outperforming evolution.
