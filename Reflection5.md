## Question:
##### Using  these  ideas  from  Aral,  Georgescu-Roegen,  and  Geoff  West  as  well  as  other sources  from  this  semester  (including  your  own  personal  insights  and  reflections), how is the advent of data science serving to advance our understanding of complex adaptive, economic and social systems? Where  have  we  witnessed  significant  gains  in  our  ability  to  describe,  analyze  and  predict human development processes?   Where do you anticipate hope for using data science as the  means  to  elevate  our  understanding  of  individual  and  community  scale  behavior?  Where do you identify or anticipate reasons to be concerned about the use of data science in a manner that could serve to harm?   What are some of the major obstacles that exist in order  for  data  science  to  contribute  towards  reducing  unfreedoms  and  improving  upon  the sum  total  of  freedoms  we  experience  as  humanity?    What  is  your  prediction  for  how  data science can serve to improve the human condition?<br>

## Response:
I believe that one of humans’ greatest accomplishments over the last few decades has been development of massive computational power which has brought about the information era and transformed much of developed life. Through shiny new tools like data science, predictive models, machine learning, and now AI, humanity has an ability to make informed decisions and analyze the world like never before. Significant issues slowing scientific breakthrough have always been a failure to find conclusive data and failure to draw the right (and often difficult to identify) conclusions from a dataset. Both of these issues are now partially remedied through data science, as currently humanity is tracking and quantifying the world around us to a massive degree and with the creation of predictive models and broader data science tools, many conclusions that are not visible to the naked eye are now within our grasp. 

In this way data science has already transformed scientific research and will continue to do so throughout the future. As an interdisciplinary field, data science has gained vital importance throughout much of research as it allows researchers to draw conclusions simply from unlikely correlations which statistical models can locate with great accuracy. However while this is a significant strength of data science, as it is massively cost saving and provides an arterially made ingenuity that can test many theories in record time, there are also drawbacks to this correlation over causation method. As Kitchin and Anderson both discussed in their respective articles, the emphasis of correlation is a threat to the proper scientific method – as it emphasizes searching and using statistical trends instead of fully understanding their context. For this reason although data science has the potential to massively help the scientific world (and all humans as a result), it must be applied through interdisciplinary research that make full use of the scientific method and does not draw hasty conclusions. Only in this way can data science help scientific progress while minimizing the issues of all too simple to make correlational mistakes.

Data science is poised not only to revolutionize scientific research, but also economic decisions and general human development. Data science (in some basic form) has already been in use for the last couple decades -  helping companies develop their bottom line. Models trained on massive companies’ extensive datasets have been able to reach conclusions that would be unimaginable for many managers – earning or saving millions of dollars in the process. Problems like where to locate goods in a store for optimum profits and how to effectively locate advertisements to drive sales can be handled through a trained predictive model which finds often odd but influential correlations with great skill. However as Kitchin notes in “Big Data, New Epistemologies and Paradigm Shifts” a severe limitation of predictive models and much of data science, is they will often overfit data and use them to reach correlation conclusions.  These correlations can not only cause analysts to draw inaccurate conclusions (correlation does not mean causation), but also has the disadvantage of not providing analysts with a reason for this conclusion. All the same, just like in science, correlation on its own has proven to be quite useful for many companies although has some limitations due to it requiring large and comprehensive data sets (which are often privately held) – although sometimes the data sets can get so large that finding correlations even become difficult (such as in the Large Hadron Collider).

Additionally correlation and data science can prove useful for greater economic purposes than only corporate decision making. As Owen Barder develops in detail, economists of the past have frequently failed at finding a good method by which to develop undeveloped countries safely, fairly, and rapidly. Although many countries and organizations are willing to invest and loan massive sums of money in order to help the poor develop, this money is frequently squandered, stolen, or used to prop up dictatorship – to little benefit of normal people. Many economic models have been built in response – saying that certain factors should be prioritized over others for ideal development, but as Barder explains they often are met with failure. He hypothesizes that the best solution to this issue is found in modern data science. Although in the past economists have only succeeded in developing linear economic models for human development, now through the use of complicated and mutli-part neural models data science can be used to plot and estimate complex adaptive systems such as entire governments and economies. If this is done successfully then the potential benefit for humanity could be greater than in any other application. Through helping to develop and industrialize undeveloped countries, data science has the potential save millions of lives (from starvation, malaria, and other illnesses) and rapidly improve countless others. Although this concept has not currently been taken to its full potential, its very likely that the greatest uses of data science will be in the assisting of making important decisions that affect countries, companies, and people all over the world.
