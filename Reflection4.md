#### Question #1. Provide three examples from Geoff West’s reading that illustrate how scale can be used to more fully understand human development as a complex and adapting social and economic system.  Additionally, what did Geoff West have to say about the use of theory and big data?  According to West, can a theory be relevant in the face of big data?  Provide an example.

#### Response:
In his book ‘Scale’ Geoff West applies a variety of mathematical, technical, and statistical analysis to surprisingly broad topics – such as the growth of cities and companies, natural limitations on biological life, the general growth of our society and other topics. Through examining and reaching overarching conclusions about what would seem to be categorically different groups, West shows that some rules apply to many parts of our world and that we can glean conclusions through finding laws governing all parts of our society. A particular emphasis of his is the power of scaling – that as an organism, society, or environment grows there are certain trends about the scale of growth which can be analyzed to provide conclusions about the subject in question.

West focuses significantly on the topic of the development of cities. He describes that as cities grow (with scale) they are governed by some of the same laws that govern the growth of organisms, increasing returns to scale or superlinear scaling. As a city grows with increasing population and increasing social interaction between its citizens, the city becomes more effective with each person producing more GDP per capita, patents and income, and the city requiring fewer infrastructure (in proportion to population). This is similar to the growth of organisms- where larger organisms are far more effective with their energy management than smaller ones (Kleiber’s Law)- so with increasing scale larger organisms are able to survive (basal metabolic rate) on less energy per mass than smaller organisms. The rule of the organism clearly also applies to the complex adaptive system of a city. West therefore develops that similar to laws governing biology, the growth of cities also follows growth laws that establish significant similarities between any city. Although they do not follow all biological rules, for instance growing cities include a systematically increasing pace of life, while larger organisms generally slow down with size.

A further topic that West analyzes, which is related to human development, is the creation and growth trend that companies follow, which also reveals some findings with scale. West argues the trends governing businesses have similarities with both organisms and cities, but due to the mortal nature of companies they more closely follow biological rules. Companies are initially created according to some innovation, often a new idea or marketing ploy, and they usually experience rapid growth and development (superlinear scaling) as they rise to fill up the market space. However as they reach maturity, they must repeatedly increase beauracracy, therefore lowering their mobility and limiting innovation, eventually leading to sublinear scaling and stagnation. Like organisms eventually all companies die, so making them different from (so-far) ever growing cities. However all three have scaling characteristics, with a scaling exponent of 0.9 (efficiency and production with increasing size) for companies. By analyzing companies Geoff shows there are some characteristics which are common to all private business, and that statistical analysis can identify their weaknesses and strengths.

One additional topic that West analyzes in depth is the effect of scaling on social models and our society as a whole. A city is essentially a massive social network that interconnects many people involved in different things, for mutual benefit (increased income and consumption) and detriment (crime, poverty, and illness). Although these models are rarely designed on purpose (with the exception of organized city and infrastructure creation like in China) they often have significant similarities between different cities. Although some academics in the 20th century believed that cities naturally form crystal lattice shapes, with a central hub surrounded by layers of villages and towns, more recent analysis of naturally developed cities and infrastructure use shows a more distinct fractal shape with a central hub leaving pathways off in every direction. This massive connective organism – developed society – has changed our life in many ways that West analyzes. Firstly we are massively connected with the rest of developed society as never before, and as Milgram shows the average person in the U.S. is just 6 personal connections away from each of us. Additionally city life has caused an overload for members of society, causing standards for curtesy and assistance to strangers to fall significantly – allowing for increasing crime and aggression in cities. However despite this overload of strangers and random people in urban lives, further analysis by Dunbar shows that we are not much more social than our Neolithic ancestors – with humans mainly interacting within a social circle of 150 people of various closeness and friendliness. These findings show that as our social network expands, we become in contact with a massive amount of people, causing our ethic and social standards to shift, but we are generally only able to maintain the same level of closeness that we had in societies in the past. West’s analysis of social networks provide several conclusions, but do not guarantee any future behavior, as society is still broadly changing.

Geoff West also spoke in detail about scientific methodology and theory, and how best to combine it with the rising phenomena of big data. West stated that all scientists generally applaud the creation of massive data sets, as they allow for finding conclusive and powerful evidence for many experiments and theories. The general rise of machine learning in complement with big data is also a powerful tool as the search for correlations can reveal surprising truths that researchers may not have found otherwise. However West emphasizes that big data and machine learning used in isolation from scientific methodology and theory and general deep knowledge of the subject matter is dangerous. As he mentions several times, this can cause ‘drowning in data’ where researchers leap at correlations without considering the ultimate causes and scientific validity of this data. He generally notes that big data is a powerful tool that needs to be applied with interdisciplinary knowledge to further science. One example he provides is the creation of the Large Hadron Collider to test for the existence of the Higgs particle. The LHC creates an impossibly large amount of data, so gleaning findings from this dataset is only possible through the development of theories ahead of time, so as to determine which data to concentrate on and test. Luckily the success of the LHC in finding the Higgs particle shows that these efforts are possible, and that all researchers should strive after them.
